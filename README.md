### 🌸🌸 Welcome! 🌸🌸

I am currently looking for work as a software developer, data engineer, or SDET!

I began coding in July 2021 and have since worked as a software developer for a global IT consultancy and completed a data science bootcamp in December 2022.  

While I'm in a perpetual state of learning, if I _had_ to pick a specialty it would be JavaScript/TypeScript + React development. After my bootcamp I've spent most of my time attempting to build data pipelines for updating machine learning models (lots of Python and AWS).

### (Mostly) Completed Projects ✔️
- `corpus-ranker` is a web app that serves as a visual aid for observing the effects of adjusting hyperparameters for scikit-learn's NearestNeighbor module. 
- `Sentitext` is a simple text editor that performs sentiment analysis and changes the background color accordingly.  

### Active Projects 🚧:
- `roffle` is my in-progress capstone project for my data science bootcamp. Trying out various AWS services before settling on a project infrastructure.
- `hiroshis_hadoop_playground` and `DS_deploy_AWS` contain content I intend on sharing as guides/tutorials.
