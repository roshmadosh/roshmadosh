You'll find I spend most of my time doing stuff in Typescript, React, Python, and Java.  

### (Mostly) Completed Projects ✔️
- `corpus-ranker` is a web app that serves as a visual aid for observing the effects of adjusting hyperparameters for scikit-learn's NearestNeighbor module. 
- `Sentitext` is a simple text editor that performs sentiment analysis and changes the background color accordingly.  

### Active Projects 🚧:
- `roffle` is my in-progress capstone project for my data science bootcamp. Trying out various AWS services before settling on a project infrastructure.
- `hiroshis_hadoop_playground` and `DS_deploy_AWS` contain content I intend on sharing as guides/tutorials.
